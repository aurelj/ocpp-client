### Code Style

Please adhere to the following guidelines to maintain consistency in the codebase:

- Use [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) to format your code.
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Ensure all existing and new tests pass (`cargo test`).

### Commit Messages

Use clear and descriptive commit messages. A good commit message should:

- Describe the change in the imperative mood ("Fix bug" rather than "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug").
- Include any relevant issue numbers (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

### Documentation

Improving documentation is one of the easiest ways to contribute. You can help by:

- Improving existing documentation for clarity and completeness.
- Adding new examples to demonstrate how to use the library.
- Correcting any typos or grammatical errors.
